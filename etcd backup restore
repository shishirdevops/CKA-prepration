Backup:

check paths either from pod of etcd or from yaml from manifest dir
and then run below to take snapshot:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --endpoints=https://[127.0.0.1]:2379 \
--cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
--cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
--key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key \
snapshot save /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db


Restore:

ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl  --data-dir /var/lib/etcd-from-backup \
snapshot restore /opt/snapshot-pre-boot.db

Next, update the /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml:

We have now restored the etcd snapshot to a new path on the controlplane - /var/lib/etcd-from-backup, so, the only change to be made in the YAML file, 
is to change the hostPath for the volume called etcd-data from old directory (/var/lib/etcd) to the new directory /var/lib/etcd-from-backup.

  volumes:
  - hostPath:
      path: /var/lib/etcd-from-backup
      type: DirectoryOrCreate
    name: etcd-data
With this change, /var/lib/etcd on the container points to /var/lib/etcd-from-backup on the controlplane (which is what we want)

When this file is updated, the ETCD pod is automatically re-created as this is a static pod placed under the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory.
